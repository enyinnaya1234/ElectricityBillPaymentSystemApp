### Project Structure and API Endpoints
**AuthController**
This controller manages user registration and login.

POST /auth/register: Registers a new user with details in RegisterUserDto.
POST /auth/login: Authenticates a user and returns a token.

**ElectricityController**
This controller handles bill operations and wallet management.

POST /api/electricity/verify: Verifies a bill using details in CreateBillDTO and initiates a bill creation event.

Troubleshooting
---------------

*   Database Connection Issues: Ensure SQL Server is running and the connection string in appsettings.json is correct.
    
*   CORS Issues: Ensure CORS is properly configured in your ASP.NET Core application. You can modify the CORS settings in Program.cs if needed.
    
*   Port Conflicts: Ensure the ports you are using are not already in use on your machine.
    

Assumptions
-----------

*   The database is initialized with necessary tables and schema. If not, ensure migrations are applied successfully.
    
*   You have the required environment variables set up for your connection strings and other configurations.
    
*   The project uses default ports for SQL Server and the API. Adjust the ports in launchSettings.json or appsettings.json if necessary.
